# ita-email-template
ITA email is a template which is easy and flexible to use. The user has the option to add in custom sections of pre made 
templates, drag and drop the order of the sections, change the background colours of sections dynamically, and finally be able to add call to actions buttons using 
various styles on the button itself.
